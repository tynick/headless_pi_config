# headless_pi_config
A script to easily provision a newly imaged Raspberry Pi SD card before first boot.

This script was written to run on a Mac and assumes the location of your SD card is /Volumes/boot/. 
You can change this path in the card_path variable if you know what you are doing.

# How to run
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tynick/headless_pi_config.git
cd headless_pi_config
./headless_pi_config.sh
```
